## LCL Filter Example

Plots the step responses of an LCL output filter that may have
been included with the HWPV model training. The control design
may require that the LCL effects be "backed out" of the HWPV model,
and the step responses provide useful information for developing
that compensation. To run the example:

    python lcl_test.py

The 1-phase LCL filter responses are plotted. To plot the 3-phase
LCL filter, change line 19 of the Python code.
